# Image-Point-Matching-ANN-Algorithm
In this project, our main objective was to enhance image point matching using a sophisticated algorithm known as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN). To achieve this, we developed specialized data structures from the ground up, including Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Randomized KD-Trees (RKDT).
